# [Utopian Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/utopian-tree/problem)
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after ***n*** growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is ***n = 5***, the calculations are as follows:
```
Period  Height
0          1
1          2
2          3
3          6
4          7
5          14
```

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer, ***t***, the number of test cases.

***t*** subsequent lines each contain an integer, ***n***, the number of cycles for that test case.
## Constrains
***1 <= t <= 10***

***0 <= n <= 60***
